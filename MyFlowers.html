          Did you know there are over 400,000 plant species across the world? In other words, that s more than the
          number of bird, butterfly and bee species, combined! While many flowers grow naturally in forests, grasslands,
          deserts and tundras, growing your own garden or picking up some unique flowers is a great way to create your
          own oasis.

          How do you pick the right type of flowers for your needs? With literally hundreds of thousands to choose from,
          it can be overwhelming! That s why we ve compiled our handy guide below of 151 Most Common Flower Types in the
          U.S. Wondering how much sun or soil your flower will need? Where it grows best? How to make a fabulous flower
          bouquet for your indoor table? Scroll through our alphabetical list of flower names and gardening information
          to find your perfect bloom!
        </h5>

        <p>
          A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants
          (plants of the division Angiospermae). The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction,
          usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion
          of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from cross-pollination or allow
          selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs.

          The two types of pollination are: self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens when the
          pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant.
          Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a
          different individual of the same species. Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel
          mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This
          pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for
          pollinators.[1]

          Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the
          site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to
          be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit
          containing seeds.

          In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by
          humans to bring beauty to the environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, esotericism, witchcraft,
          religion, medicine, and as a source of food.

            Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of
            cultivars.[citation needed] They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing,<img data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal" src="../images/rose.jpg" class="imgin" alt="">
            with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles.[citation needed] Their flowers vary in size and shape
            and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are
            native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe,
            North America, and northwestern Africa.[citation needed] Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown
            for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose
            plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in
            height.[citation needed] Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of
            the wide range of garden roses.

          </div>
          <div class="panel-body collapse" id="ex2">Jasmine (taxonomic name: Jasminum; /jÃ¦sminÉm/, YASS-min-Ém[5]) is a genus of
            shrubs and vines in the olive family (Oleaceae). It contains around 200 species native to tropical and warm
            temperate regions of Eurasia, Africa, and Oceania. Jasmines are widely cultivated for the characteristic
            fragrance of their flowers. A number of unrelated plants contain the word "jasmine" in their common names
            (see Other plants called "jasmine").

            Jasmine can be either deciduous (leaves falling in autumn) or evergreen (green all year round), and can be
            erect, spreading, or climbing shrubs and vines. Their leaves are borne in opposing or alternating
            arrangement and can be of simple, trifoliate,
              <img data-toggle="modal" data-target="#modal1" src="../images/jasmine.jpg" alt="#" class="imgin">
            or pinnate formation. The flowers are typically around 2.5 cm (0.98 in) in diameter. They are white or
            yellow, although in rare instances they can be slightly reddish. The flowers are borne in cymose clusters
            with a minimum of three flowers, though they can also be solitary on the ends of branchlets. Each flower has
            about four to nine petals, two locules, and one to four ovules. They have two stamens with very short
            filaments. The bracts are linear or ovate. The calyx is bell-shaped. They are usually very fragrant. The
            fruits of jasmines are berries that turn black when ripe. The basic chromosome number of the genus is 13,
            and most species are diploid (2n=26). However, natural polyploidy exists, particularly in Jasminum sambac
            (triploid 3n=39), Jasminum flexile (tetraploid 4n=52), Jasminum mesnyi (triploid 3n=39), and Jasminum
            angustifolium (tetraploid 4n=52).[6]

            Different species, cultivars and hybrids of the rose flower are widely grown for their beauty and fragrance.
            Rose plants can range from small, miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven metres in height.
            Rose flowers can be either low-maintenance or high-maintenance. Old garden roses and shrub roses required
            little to no care to sustain while hybrid tea and polyantha or modern roses are considered high-maintenance
            species.
            Rose flowers are sometimes used as food, and very commonly used as flavouring or scents.
            Roses are the epitome of beauty, because of their dazzling colour combination, sweet scent, delicate and
            fragile petals.
            In western culture, the red roseâs significance dates back to Greek mythology, and the belief that the
            Goddess of love created roses.
            Rose flowers are most commonly associated with love and romance, and sometimes secrecy or confidentiality.
            Floribunda roses are among the longest blooming roses because they can bloom continuously from early spring
            to late fall, depending on the cultivars.
            Pink roses symbolise gratitude, grace and joy. They also suggest gentleness compared to a typical bright red
            rose.
            Blue roses are not natural but can be obtained through dyeing.

            leaves and beautiful clusters of fragrant flowers.

            Flowering in Jasmines takes place in summer or spring which is usally six months after planting. The Jasmine
            flower releases its fragrance at night after the sun has set and especially when the moon is waxing towards
            fullness. Jasmine flower buds are more fragrant than the flowers.

            There exists a true Jasmine and a false Jasmine, and the two are commonly mistaken for each other because of
            the fragrance the plants release. The true Jasmine belongs to the family Oleaceae and is primarily a bushy
            shrub or a climbing vine and is non-poisonous.

            True Jasmines have oval, shiny leaves and tubular, waxy-white flowers. The false Jasmine on the other hand
            is in a completely different genus, Gelsemium, and family, Loganiaceae, which is considered too poisonous
            for human consumption.
